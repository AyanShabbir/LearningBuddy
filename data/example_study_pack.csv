lc_001,Science,Easy,"Plants make food using sunlight, water, and air. This process is called photosynthesis."
lc_002,Science,Medium,"Photosynthesis is the process by which green plants use sunlight to convert carbon dioxide and water into food and oxygen."
lc_003,Science,Hard,"Photosynthesis involves light-dependent reactions in the thylakoid membranes and light-independent reactions in the stroma, producing glucose and oxygen."
lc_004,Science,Easy,"Mitosis is when a cell splits to make two identical cells."
lc_005,Science,Medium,"Mitosis is a type of cell division that results in two daughter cells, each with the same number and type of chromosomes as the parent."
lc_006,Science,Hard,"Mitosis includes phases: prophase, metaphase, anaphase, and telophase, ensuring equal chromosome distribution."
lc_007,Math,Easy,"A fraction represents a part of a whole. Example: 1/2 means one out of two equal parts."
lc_008,Math,Medium,"To add fractions, make sure the denominators are the same, then add the numerators."
lc_009,Math,Hard,"Fractions can be added or subtracted by first finding the least common denominator, then performing the operation on the numerators."
lc_010,Geography,Easy,"The water cycle describes how water moves from oceans to the atmosphere and back to land."
lc_011,Geography,Medium,"Evaporation, condensation, precipitation, and collection are the main stages of the water cycle."
lc_012,Geography,Hard,"The hydrologic cycle includes processes such as infiltration, runoff, transpiration, and groundwater flow, maintaining Earth's water balance."
lc_013,Science,Easy,"The Earth orbits the Sun once every 365 days, which creates a year."
lc_014,Science,Medium,"The Earth's rotation on its axis causes day and night, while its revolution around the Sun causes seasons."
lc_015,Science,Hard,"Earth's axial tilt of 23.5 degrees, combined with its orbit, produces varying solar insolation, creating the seasons."
lc_016,Math,Easy,"Addition combines numbers to find the total. Example: 2 + 3 = 5."
lc_017,Math,Medium,"Subtraction finds the difference between numbers. Example: 5 - 2 = 3."
lc_018,Math,Hard,"Operations with integers include addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, following the order of operations (PEMDAS)."
lc_019,Geography,Easy,"Continents are large land masses on Earth. There are seven continents."
lc_020,Geography,Medium,"Earth's continents are Asia, Africa, North America, South America, Antarctica, Europe, and Australia."
lc_021,Geography,Hard,"Continental drift theory explains how tectonic plate movements shaped the current distribution of continents over geological time."
